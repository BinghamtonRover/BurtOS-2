These are utility libraries from the 2021 competition year and earlier. New programs should not use these libraries as they are being phased out. Replacement is scheduled for each component:

* Timer/Clock Utilities -> std::chrono
* Logger -> Boost.Log
* ~~Simpleconfig -> Boost.PropertyTree~~ (DONE)
